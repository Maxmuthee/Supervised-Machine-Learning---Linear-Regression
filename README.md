📊 Linear Regression Comparison Project
This repository demonstrates and compares three different linear regression techniques using the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn. The project explores Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression to understand their differences, strengths, and appropriate use cases.

🚀 Features
Implementation of three regression models:
OLS (Ordinary Least Squares): Basic linear regression
Ridge Regression: L2 regularization for handling multicollinearity
Lasso Regression: L1 regularization for feature selection
Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
Visualization of coefficients and model performance
Hyperparameter tuning for Ridge and Lasso
Comparison of model behaviors and trade-offs
